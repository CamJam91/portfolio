Design throughline
- Simple overall design
- Soft off white colors
- header and links same font style and size or very similar
- Far letter spacing
- In an effort to keep links and headers uniform throughout entire project either
	1. Use portfolio as a link to home and have all links stay in place no matter what page
		-downside is that the page user is on will have a useless link to current page
	2. Have links change dynamically but use letter-spacing to make a uniform block of text
		- downside is that letter-spacing might look a little odd. 

Homepage has name on top left as h1. Portfolio at top right as h1. 
-put about me section here instead of about me page?
- or keep it as a simple landing page?

Essays page
- same structure as home but block of text to the left.
